 Explanation of Each File
1. airfoil.py (Handles Airfoil Generation & Loading)
Generates NACA 4-digit airfoils.
Loads airfoils from .dat files.
2. panels.py (Panel Discretization)
Discretizes the airfoil shape into panels (line segments).
Computes panel normals, tangents, and control points.
3. solver.py (Implements the Panel Method)
Solves for source/sink and vortex strengths.
Computes velocity and pressure distribution.
4. visualize.py (Handles Plotting)
Plots the airfoil shape, panel distribution, velocity field, etc.
5. main.py (Runs the Full Solver)
Calls the functions from all other files.
Controls execution flow.
